# Robotics Arm Manipulation and Block Detection Project

This is a project manipulating 6 DOF robotics arm with kinematics, gripper design, and block detection with Kinect. The project was written in python with OpenCV for block detection. The gripper was designed in Solidworks to fulfill the action of grasping and repositioning for accurate block placing. 
The camera was then calibrated with intrinsic and extrinsic calibration.
